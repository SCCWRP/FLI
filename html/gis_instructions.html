<p>To get environmental data for your stations, prepare a CSV file with columns "StationCode", "Long", and "Lat" (case sensitive). Make sure that the StationCodes in this file match with the StationCodes in your BMI data file. Upload your data, and the results with a download button will be returned. This is computationally intensive, and depending on the number of stations submitted it may take a few moments to return the results.</p>

<p>The results will have your original file appended with three new columns:</p>

<ul>
<li>ppt: estimated precipation in nanometers per annum</li>
<li>temp: estimated average annual temperature in degrees celsius * 100</li>
<li>elevation: estimated elevation in meters</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to download your results so you can upload them to be used in the FLI calculation.<p>

<p>If you notice missing data in the results, check to make sure that the location of the station is within the State of California.<p>
