<p>This Family Level Index (FLI) is an educational tool designed to emulate the analysis of
the California Streams Condition Index (CSCI), but with significantly less requirements
on the input data. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxonomic effort level has been reduced. Taxa need only be identified to the family level</li>
<li>The number of environmental predictors required has been reduced. Furthermore, environmental data can be generated with only station coordinates using the "Get GIS data" tool </li>
<li>While adequate sample sizes for the CSCI are >= 500, data for the FLI may be subsampled down to an arbitrary amount (though lower than 100 is not recommended)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>To use this tool, first submit your station cooridinates as a CSV file with columns "StationCode", "Lat", and "Long" (<a href="stations_example.csv">see example</a>). Then, check to make sure that your benthic macroinvertibrate (BMI) data are formatted correctly (<a href="BMI_example.csv">see example</a>). Upload the BMI and GIS data, choose a subsampling threshold value, and submit. The primary results should be displayed in the browser. To view other aspects of the results, such as the MMI metric scores or OE capture probabilities, select a different report and press Get Report. This will open the report as a CSV file.</p>
