This Family Level Index (FLI) is an educational tool designed to emulate the analysis of the California Streams Condition Index (CSCI), but with significantly less requirements on the input data. Specifically:

* Taxonomic effort level has been reduced. Taxa need only be identified to the family level
* The number of environmental predictors required has been reduced. Furthermore, environmental data can be generated with only station coordinates using the "Get GIS data" tool
* While adequate sample sizes for the CSCI are >= 500, data for the FLI may be subsampled down to an arbitrary amount (though lower than 100 is not recommended)
